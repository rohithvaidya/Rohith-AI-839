    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be daunting for travellers to visit a new country, since they are unfamiliar with the culture and language of the new place. Currently, english widely serves as a link langauge for communication in most countries. There are gaps in communication when neither the traveller nor the native of the host country are natively english speaking. On the travellers side, he/ she may find it difficult to clearly pose his question and the host also probably understands the question in a different way. \n",
